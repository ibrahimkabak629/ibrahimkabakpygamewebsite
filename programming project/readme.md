 Space Shamblers



- concept :-  
  (Space invaders, silent hill) it's a top down shooter that you have to escape EM by killing all enemies in all stages (or can you...) as for silent hill 

- How to run the game :-  
  first since you have to run the code you need a code editor software then install python from google after that download pygame (via: command prompt) then type into the terminal & the following `( pip install --upgrade pygame )` this prompt gives you the latest version of pygame if you don't have it already then you open the .py file and run the game but keep in mind run the game with the assets folder and the .py file in the same folder for the code to find the assets and implement them into the code.
